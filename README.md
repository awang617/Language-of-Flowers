# The Language of Flowers Dictionary
This app is a dictionary for the language of flowers. Visitors can search by name or meaning depending on what they are looking for. The flexible search bar outputs results as you type. You can also click on the results to pull up a more detailed page with the flower/plant's information including an image and short description.

I wanted to create this app to be able to quickly search and find flower meanings. Online flower dictionaries are often a single page and difficult to navigate on mobile. I wanted something that would function well on a phone screen or computer.

## Challenges
Adding styling to this project was a bit difficult. I built the project for functionality first and ignored the styling until later. I found that styling is very different in React projects and it took me some time to remember how to use external styling components. Once I figured it out and adjusted my app to look more presentable, I discovered that some of the components were not compatible with the search logic. I had to rework some of the functions so they would work with the external components.

## Successes
Getting all the logic to initially work for the flexible search bar was a big success. React has a lot of functionality built into it that makes it easier to quickly change your component and toggle my API calls. Fixing my app after breaking it with external components was also a big success for me.

## Results
This project was completed after a little longer than a week and I completed the React front end for my language of flowers dictionary. I found this project to be very helpful with getting myself familiar with React again especially on a project on my own. I'm happy with the end project and fulfilled the scope of what I wanted this project to be.
